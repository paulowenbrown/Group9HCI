To run our program simply open up our index.html file in Google Chrome.  

This will take you to our login page where we have autofilled a user account to use, but feel free to create your own.   
The credentials to the premade user account are username: "admin", and password: "password".  
There is also a Guest User option which gives the ability to use the app but restricts access to the Account Page.  
We hope you enjoy using our application!
